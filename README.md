# Transaction Recap — Learning Project

## What This Is

This repository is used for remote mentoring through practical work.

The goal is to learn independence, responsibility, and problem-solving by working with real transaction data and producing business reports.

This is not a tutorial, a production system, or an application project. This is a **learning-by-doing workspace**.

## How This Works

### Tasks
Each task is defined in the `tasks/` directory. Tasks describe:
- The problem to solve
- Required outputs
- Definition of done

### Submissions
Work is submitted in `submissions/<name>/` directories. Each submission includes:
- Artifacts (files, reports, etc.)
- Documentation explaining decisions and assumptions

### Review
Completed work is reviewed based on:
- Clarity of reasoning
- Honesty about uncertainty
- Reconciliation with source data
- Ability to explain decisions

## Current Task: Task 01 — Categorize & Recap

Read the full task description in [tasks/TASK_01_CATEGORIZE_AND_RECAP.md](tasks/TASK_01_CATEGORIZE_AND_RECAP.md).

**Summary**: Analyze transaction data, create categorization rules, and produce a monthly spending recap per user by category.

**Constraint**: CSV-only. No SQL, no databases, no frameworks.

**Output**: Place all deliverables in `submissions/shawn/`

## Boundaries

### Not Allowed (Yet)
- SQL or databases
- Backend frameworks (Java, Spring Boot, etc.)
- DevOps tooling (Docker, CI/CD, etc.)
- Over-engineering

### Allowed
- CSV files
- Spreadsheets (Excel, Google Sheets, etc.)
- Simple scripts (Python, if needed)
- AI tools (with accountability)

### Using AI
AI tools are allowed as thinking aids. However:
- Copy–paste without understanding is not allowed
- Any AI-assisted work must be explainable in your own words

---

## Philosophy

- Work comes before theory
- Problems come before tools
- Explanation matters more than speed
- Redo is normal, not a penalty
- "I don't know" is acceptable; pretending is not

Success means understanding how data represents reality, structuring thinking clearly, and being accountable for work quality.
